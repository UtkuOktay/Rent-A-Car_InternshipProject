This project was made with .NET 6.

This project has 2 classes. One is providing unique car IDs and the other is providing unique slugs for each car. 1 controller and 1 model, which is car.

The controller has five endpoints that provide a list, search, add, delete, and update cars. You can see endpoint documentation inside the project file.

It is a simple project that helps to understand web.api, endpoints, and .NET6.

We didn't use SQL for saving data; we listed our cars inside the controller.

We have a swagger UI for development.
