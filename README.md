This project was made with .NET 6.
This project has 1 controller and 1 model, which is car.
The controller has five endpoints that provide a list, search, add, delete, and update cars. You can see endpoint documentation inside the project file.
We didn't use SQL for saving data; we listed our cars inside the controller.
It is a simple project that helps to understand web.api, endpoints, and .NET6.
We have a swagger UI for development.
